## WIDesigner
Woodwind Instrument Designer

WIDesigner is a Java application to assist the design of woodwind instruments.
In its current version, it calculates instrument dimensions to provide optimum tuning accuracy
over the range of an instrument.
The current release supports only fipple flutes.
The source code includes a prototype transverse flute model.
We hope to add reed instruments in the near future.

[Using WIDesigner](https://github.com/edwardkort/WWIDesigner/wiki/Using-WIDesigner) describes
the current instantiation of the application, and summarizes how to use it. 

Before we include the transverse flute model in a release, we need to calibrate it,
and this requires more data from real flutes. Unfortunately, none of the current contributors
has the flute skills to collect this data.
Flute players interested in assisting are asked to contact one of the contributors.
