## WIDesigner
Woodwind Instrument Designer

WIDesigner is a Java application to assist the design of woodwind instruments.
In its current version, it calculates instrument dimensions to provide optimum tuning accuracy
over the range of an instrument.
At present, it supports only fipple flutes, but we hope to add transverse flutes and reeds in the near future.

[Using WIDesigner](https://github.com/edwardkort/WWIDesigner/wiki/Using-WIDesigner) describes
the current instantiation of the application, and summarizes how to use it.
