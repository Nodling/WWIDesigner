Hello all,

WIDesigner v2.0.0 has just been published. This is a major-version upgrade to v1.1.0. 

Enhancements in this release:
Added a new instrument type, reed instruments. This includes single and double reed instruments, and lip-reed instruments like the didgeridoo.
Enhanced optimizer support for the more "interesting" bore profiles common to such instruments is also provided. See
  https://github.com/edwardkort/WWIDesigner/wiki/Working-with-the-Reed-Study-Model
Included a spreadsheet to assist calibration of a reed mouthpiece across multiple tubes or instruments. See ReedStudy/instruments/Calibration.xlsx in the distribution.
Added a number of instructional pages to the Wiki. See
   https://github.com/edwardkort/WWIDesigner/wiki
Added the ability to cancel long-running optimizations.
Removed the "Vary all dimensions" from the NAF multi-start optimization options. A scenario could not be found in which it converged to a better solution than the "Vary first bound variable" option (renamed to "Vary bore length").
Introduced a number of base optimizers, in particular the DIRECT family.
Automatically select the last file in a Study category when all the others have been removed.
Increased the precision of unit-of-measure conversions.
For the workhorse base optimizer, BOBYQA, removed its dependency on the initial instrument geometry in determining its convergence criteria.
Updated the NAF instrument sample files so that the pentatonic-minor tunings are in line with minor tweaks in the NAF tuning calculators.
Upgraded JIDE libraries to v3.6.16 (was v3.6.12).

A handful of bugs were also fixed.

Please see INSTALL_README.txt on the release page for installation instructions.
