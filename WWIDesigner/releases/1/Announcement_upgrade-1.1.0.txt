Hello all,

WIDesigner v1.1.0 has just been published. This is an upgrade to v1.0.7. From the release notes:
v1.1.0 changes
Bugs fixed: none
Enhancements:
Added prototype transverse flute study. See
  https://github.com/edwardkort/WWIDesigner/wiki/Working-with-the-Flute-Study-Model
Added Supplementary Info table. See
  https://github.com/edwardkort/WWIDesigner/wiki/The-Supplementary-Information-Table
Updated tonehole calculations as per:
  Antoine Lefebvre and Gary P. Scavone, Characterization of woodwind
  instrument toneholes with the finite element method, J. Acoust.
  Soc. Am. V. 131 (n. 4), April 2012
Enhanced note spectrum plot: increased frequency range, added peak
  frequency printout.
Upgraded Apache commons math3 library to v3.5 (was v3.2).
Upgraded JIDE libraries to v3.6.12 (was v3.6.8).

For makers of transverse flutes, we would appreciate your feedback concerning the prototype implementation in this release.

For NAF makers, I have updated the tonehole calculator to the lastest theory. It makes slight changes to hole size and tuning. I'm not sure, in practice, whether these changes are significant; but they cause no harm.

Expanding on the note-quality metrics introduced in v1.0.7, this release expands the capabilities of the note spectrum plot and adds a supplemental information table.

Because several referenced libraries were upgraded, this release is best implemented as a new install. Please see INSTALL_README.txt on the release page for instructions. Not to worry, all of your instrument, tuning, and constraints files will continue to work unchanged.

The work in this release was the tour de force of Burton Patkau, the author of the Whistle study (and much else). Thank you, Burton.
