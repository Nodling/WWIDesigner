Update README v1.0.3

Relative to v1.0.2, this release only changes the sample
files included that release.

So, if you have already installed v1.0.2, just download
Samples-1.0.3.zip. In the directory you had the prior
samples (WIDesigner-1.0 in the default install),
delete the "constraints" subdirectory. Then unzip the
files in that directory, retaining the directory
structure. You will want to turn off the warning on
file overwrites: the files in the zip will all
exist in the prior installation.

If you have installed a version prior to v1.0.2,
please download WIDesigner-1.0.3.zip and follow the
instructions in INSTALL_README.txt.
