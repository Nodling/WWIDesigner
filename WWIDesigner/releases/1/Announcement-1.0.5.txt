Hello all,

I have just published WIDesigner v1.0.05. This is an update to v1.0.4, primarily bug fixes. And WIDesigner now works gracefully on the Mac!

There weren't any real show stoppers in v1.0.4, but I encourage you to update to v1.0.5. You need not download the entire 9 MB release, if you already have v1.0.4. Just download WIDesigner-1.0.5.jar, and put it in your WIDesigner-1.0 folder. Please read UPDATE_README.txt for details.
