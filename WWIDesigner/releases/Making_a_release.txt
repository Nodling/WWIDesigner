Making A Release

Versions use semantic versioning numbers in the form:
<Major#>.<Minor#>.<Patch#>
A patch version is a backwards-compatible bug fix
A minor version is a backwards-compatible functional enhancement
A major version includes changes incompatible with prior versions.

Patch versions within a minor version use the same library jars.
These libraries are stored in a lib-<Major#>.<Minor#> directory.

Steps in making a release:
1. Edit WIDesigner.MF
	a. Change the Class-Path root for the jar files to the
		naming above
	b. Change the Implementation-Version to the release version
2. If this is a minor version release, create the 
	lib-<Major#>.<Minor#> directory with the necessary jars. I
	use the Export->runnable jar wizard with the Copy option to
	do this.
3. Copy to a temp directory called WIDesigner-<Major#>.<Minor#>
	a. The lib directory from step 2
	b. constraints directory
	c. NafStudy directory
	d. WhistleStudy directory, etc.
	e. UNIX_README.txt
	f. Release notes and other text files, as appropriate
	g. WIDesigner-<Major#>.<Minor#>.<Patch#>.jar, created by
		WIDesigner.jardesc using the manifest from step 1
4. Zip the directory created in step 3 using normal compression.
	Call this zip file WIDesigner-<Major#>.<Minor#>.<Patch#>.zip
5. Create a Checksums--<Major#>.<Minor#>.<Patch#>.txt file. Using
	your favorite hash tool, calculate MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 
	hashes and copy them to this file. If this is not the first
	release of this minor version, also include the hashes for
	the jar created in step 3-g
6. Copy the files created in steps 2, 3-f, 3-g (if not the first
	minor version release), any other newly created files in step 3),
	4, and 5 to the Releases/<Major#> directory in the project 
	for version control.
7. Do a commit/push with the annotated tag v<Major#>.<Minor#>.<Patch#>
8. Create a release, adding binaries:
	a. Any READMEs and release notes
	b. Checksums file
	c. Zip file (step 4)
	d. If not the first minor release, the jar file (step 3-g).
