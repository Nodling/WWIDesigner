<p>In the context of WIDesigner, a <b>Tuning</b> represents the notes (symbols and frequencies) and associated fingerings (open and closed holes) for a particular instrument.
This wizard guides you through the specification of a <b>Tuning</b> through persistable, reusable components that make up that <b>Tuning</b>.
</p>
<p>The <i><b>Scale Symbols Page</b></i> supports the specification of the <b>Scale Symbol Set</b>,
the text strings that name each note. 
Each symbol may be any length and content. On this page, you may create a set <i>de novo</i>, use as a starting 
point a number of common Western symbol sets, or load a set from a saved file. The output from this page 
can be saved to a file and/or used in subsequent pages. A valid <b>Scale Symbol Set</b>, to be saved, must 
contain a name and at least one symbol; to be used in the <i><b>Scale with Intervals Page</b></i>, it does
not need a name.</p>
<p>The <b><i>Musical Temperament Page</i></b> supports the specification of the <b>Temperament</b>, the intervals that separate the 
notes of a scale, specifying for each note its frequency ratio relative to a reference note. As in the prior page, you may 
create <i>de novo</i>, load either of two standard Western temperaments, or load an initial <b>Temperament</b>, then save 
and/or use the <b>Temperament</b> on a subsequent page.
To be saved, a <b>Temperament</b> must include a name and at least one ratio; to be used on the <i><b>Scales with Intervals Page</b></i>,
it does not need a name.</p>
<p>The <b><i>Scale with Intervals Page</i></b> supports the specification of a <b>Scale with Intervals</b>, which is the merging of 
a <b>Scale Symbol Set</b> and a <b>Temperament</b> (Intervals). Both the <b>Symbols</b> and <b>Temperament</b> can be loaded from their 
respective page or from a file, created <i>de novo</i> (but not saved), and modified. <b>The Scale with Intervals</b> may be 
created <i>de novo</i>, or by dragging and dropping selected symbols and ratios from the surrounding respective tables. 
Currently, a <b>Scale with Intervals</b> can not be saved to a file, only used on a subsequent page. A valid <b>Scale with Intervals</b>
contains at least one note with both a symbol and ratio.</p>
<p>The <b><i>Scale with Frequencies Page</i></b> supports the specification of a <b>Scale with Frequencies</b>, 
which is a set of notes each defined by a symbol and a frequency (in Hz). A <b>Scale with Frequencies</b> may
be created in a number of ways: <i>de novo</i>, entering values directly in the Notes table; by loading an 
existing <b>Scale</b> file and optionally modifying it; or by calculating the frequencies from the intervals
in a <b>Scale with Intervals</b> and the absolute frequency of a reference note in that scale. A <b>Scale with Frequencies</b>
may be saved if it has a name and at least one note with a symbol and frequency. To be used in subsequent pages, a <b>Scale
with Frequencies</b> does not need a name</p>
<p>The <i><b>Fingering Pattern Page</b></i> supports the specification of a <b>Fingering Pattern</b>, the set of <b>Fingerings</b>
used for a given instrument. Each <b>Fingering</b> is the specification of open and closed holes for a particular note (to be 
defined on a subsequent page). A <b>Fingering Pattern</b> may be created <i>de novo</i>, or from an existing <b>Fingering Pattern</b>
file. To create a <b>Fingering Pattern</b> <i>de novo</i>, first set the number of holes for the instrument.
A closed hole has a dark center, an open hole has a clear center. A <b>Fingering</b> that is being edited has a red border;
to accept the edits, either press &lt;TAB&gt;, &lt;ENTER&gt;, or click on another <b>Fingering</b>; &lt;ESC&gt; cancels the
edit. A selected <b>Fingering</b> has either a red or black border. A <b>Fingering Pattern</b> may be saved if it has a name and
at least one <b>Fingering</b>; to be used in subsequent pages, it need not have a name.</p>
<p>The <i><b>Scale with Frequencies and Fingerings Page</b></i> creates a <b>Tuning</b>, which is the merging of a <b>Scale
with Frequencies</b> and a <b>Fingering Pattern</b>. A <b>Tuning</b> is central to WIDesigner, used as a goal in instrument
geometry optimization and to evaluate the tuning of an instrument. A <b>Tuning</b> may be created <i>de novo</i>, by loading
(and modifying) an existing <b>Tuning</b> file, or by merging selected notes (from the <b>Scale</b>
table) and selected fingerings (from the <b>Fingerings</b> table) through drag-and-drop. Before performing drag-and-drop operations,
create a <b>Tuning</b> either by loading an existing <b>Tuning</b> file, or by specifying the number of holes and clicking the New button.
The creation and editing of fingerings in the <b>Tuning</b>
table follow the same guidelines as in the <i><b>Fingering Pattern Page</b></i>. To be saved, a <b>Tuning</b> must have a name
and at least one fingering (a zero-hole fingering is fine) with symbol and frequency.</p>
