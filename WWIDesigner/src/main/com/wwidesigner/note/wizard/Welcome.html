<p>In the context of WWIDesigner, a <b>Tuning</b> represents the notes (symbols and frequencies) and associated fingerings (open and closed holes) for a particular instrument.
This wizard guides you in the specification of a <b>Tuning</b> and all of the optional persistable, reusable components that make up that <b>Tuning</b>.
</p><p>The <i><b>Scale Symbols Page</b></i> supports the specification of the <b>Scale Symbol Set</b>, the arbitrary symbols that identify each note. 
Each symbol may be any length and content. On this page, you may create a set <i>de novo</i>, use as a starting 
point a number of common Western symbol sets, or load one from a saved file. And the output from this page 
can be saved to a file and/or used in subsequent pages. A valid <b>Scale Symbol Set</b>, to be saved, must 
contain a name and at least one symbol; to be used in the <i><b>Scale with Intervals Page</b></i>, it does
not need a name.</p>
<p>The <b><i>Musical Temperament Page</i></b> supports the specification of the <b>Temperament</b>, the intervals that separate the 
notes of a scale - defined as a frequency ratio relative to the root note. As in the prior page, you may 
create <i>de novo</i>, load from a couple of Western-standard, or load from file the initial <b>Temperament</b>, saving 
and/or using the <b>Temperament</b>. A valid <b>Temperament</b> must contain,  to be saved, a name and at least one ratio; to be used in the <i><b>Scales with Intervals Page</b></i>,
it does not need a name.</p>
<p>The <b><i>Scale with Intervals Page</i></b> supports the specification of a <b>Scale with Intervals</b>, which is the merging of 
a <b>Scale Symbol Set</b> and a <b>Temperament</b> (Intervals). Both the <b>Symbols</b> and <b>Temperament</b> can be loaded from their 
respective page or from a file, created <i>de novo</i> (but not saved), and modified. <b>The Scale with Intervals</b> may be 
created <i>de novo</i>, or by dragging and dropping selected symbols and ratios from the surrounding respective tables. 
Currently, a <b>Scale with Intervals</b> can not be persisted, only used in subsequent pages. A valid <b>Scale with Intervals</b>
contains at least one note with both a symbol and ratio.</p>
<p>The <b><i>Scale with Frequencies Page</i></b> supports the specification of a <b>Scale with Frequencies</b>, 
which is a set of notes each defined by a symbol and a frequency (in Hz). A <b>Scale with Frequencies</b> may
be created in a number of ways: <i>De novo</i>, entering values directly in the Notes table; by loading an 
existing <b>Scale</b> file and optionally modifying it; or by calculating the frequencies based on the intervals
in a <b>Scale with Intervals</b> and a reference note in that scale with a specified frequency.</p>
